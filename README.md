# Virtual-Machine
Virtual machine in C

# To implement:
1. GOTO - go to a specific instruction point (set the next instruction to be the next value from the program[++ip]
2. EQ - if value where ip is is zero , set next instruction to be ip = program[++ip]
3. NEQ - same as above but with not equal to zero
4. > < <= >= zero
5. EQI - pop two values and compare - goto if equal
6. NEQI - pop two values and compare - goto if not equal
7. MUL - multiply = pop two values and multiply them
8. PRINTT - print the value at the top of the stack
