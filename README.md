# Virtual-Machine
Virtual machine in C

# To implement:
1. GOTO - go to a specific instruction point
2. EQ - if value where ip is is zero , set next instruction to be ip = stack[++ip]
3. NEQ - same as above but with not equal to zero
4. > < <= >= zero
5. EQI - pop two values and compare - goto if equal
6. NEQI - pop two values and compare - goto if not equal
